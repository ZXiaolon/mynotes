## Unit3
Stress is everywhere in our life. Stress is often considered negative. In the passage you have read in this unit, the author wrote: 

Research in positive psychology and organizational dynamics has shown that goal diversification is associated with subjective well-being. 
This means the act of setting and pursuing different kinds of goals that are meaningful to you is associated with less stress, which decreases the impact of allostatic load on the body and mind. 
Studies on intervention strategies to promote goal diversification have included mindfulness meditation, hope building and active self-reflection activities.

积极心理学和组织动力学的研究表明，目标多元化与主观幸福感相关。
这意味着，设定和追求对你有意义的不同类型的目标的行为会带来更少的压力，这会减少平衡负荷对身心的影响。
关于促进目标多样化的干预策略的研究包括正念冥想、建立希望和积极的自我反思活动。

From my own perspective,the stress is a double edge. Sometimes, the right amount of stress makes us more efficient, healthier and safer. But too much stress may have the opposite effect and seriously affect our physical and mental health. In today's society, we can not get rid of stress, therefore we must learn to address it.

The majority of us for the most part are prone to think the stress always is bad. But this opinion is not entirely correct. To cope with the issue, we need to correctly understand the pressure and find the source of the pressure.

Stress frequently comes from fear of the unknown. For example, we don't know whether we will pass the final exam next time, or whether they can graduate successfully, or whether they can pass the next interview; In these processes, uncertainty and fear of such uncertainty bring pressure. What we can do is to show courage to face the fear and the forthcoming challenge. We should believe that pressure makes me stronger. Only in this way can we effectively solve the pressure.

I agree those points.When we pursuit something meaningful for us, the process will not be so painful, and even some happiness. If the things we seek are not we love, we will have a version, even pressure. So it means the act of setting and pursuing a variety of goals that are meaningful to you is associated with less stress.

Rail travel can mean different things to different generations of Chinese people. Seniors may be reminded of days and nights spent lining up at railway stations to get tickets, and noisy compartments filled with passengers. Middle-aged people may possibly have a mixed image - slow but romantic green-painted trains and fast, shining, modern bullet trains.
The younger generation, those age 15 and younger, may regard the railway as a normal convenient form of travel: no longer mysterious, rather a simple fact of daily life.
The 15 years of development of China's high-speed railway sector have made travel easier, faster, fancier and more convenient.
The media has called the nation's high-speed rail network one of four new great developments of modern China, along with mobile phone payment, online shopping and shared bikes.
In most cases, the system is cheaper than air travel and much faster than regular trains.
The network now stretches 40,000 kilometers, accounting for more than two-thirds of the total length of such railways worldwide. By the end of last year, more than 80 percent of counties had access to rail services, and the high-speed network covered 93 percent of cities, with a population of more than 500,000 people.
The network runs from the humid southern coastal areas to the frozen regions of the north.
According to China State Railway Group, the national railway operator, the country's high-speed trains run at the highest speed of any such services in the world and have the greatest variety of operating scenarios. China has also developed the most comprehensive technologies and gained the richest railway management experience in the world.
The high-speed railway is an important symbol of transportation modernization, which is known for being safe, reliable, fast, convenient, energy-saving and environmentally friendly, while providing large-scale transportation capacity. With its vast territory and a large population, China, now deepening industrialization and urbanization, is embracing high-speed rail at just the right time to great significance.
