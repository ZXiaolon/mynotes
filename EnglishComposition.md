Stress is everywhere in our life. Stress is often considered negative. In the passage you have read in this unit, the author wrote: 

Research in positive psychology and organizational dynamics has shown that goal diversification is associated with subjective well-being. 
This means the act of setting and pursuing different kinds of goals that are meaningful to you is associated with less stress, which decreases the impact of allostatic load on the body and mind. 
Studies on intervention strategies to promote goal diversification have included mindfulness meditation, hope building and active self-reflection activities.

积极心理学和组织动力学的研究表明，目标多元化与主观幸福感相关。
这意味着，设定和追求对你有意义的不同类型的目标的行为会带来更少的压力，这会减少平衡负荷对身心的影响。
关于促进目标多样化的干预策略的研究包括正念冥想、建立希望和积极的自我反思活动。

From my own perspective,the stress is a double edge. Sometimes, the right amount of stress makes us more efficient, healthier and safer. But too much stress may have the opposite effect and seriously affect our physical and mental health. In today's society, we can not get rid of stress, therefore we must learn to address it.

The majority of us for the most part are prone to think the stress always is bad. But this opinion is not entirely correct. To cope with the issue, we need to correctly understand the pressure and find the source of the pressure.

Stress frequently comes from fear of the unknown. For example, we don't know whether we will pass the final exam next time, or whether they can graduate successfully, or whether they can pass the next interview; In these processes, uncertainty and fear of such uncertainty bring pressure. What we can do is to show courage to face the fear and the forthcoming challenge. We should believe that pressure makes me stronger. Only in this way can we effectively solve the pressure.

I agree those points.When we pursuit something meaningful for us, the process will not be so painful, and even some happiness. If the things we seek are not we love, we will have a version, even pressure. So it means the act of setting and pursuing a variety of goals that are meaningful to you is associated with less stress.
